    "## The Game\n",
    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranter-Go-Round):\n",
    ">Any number of players may participate, using a standard deck of 52 cards without jokers. The card rankings (from highest to lowest) are K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-A, or alternately A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2. Suits are irrelevant. The goal in each hand is to avoid ending up with a lower-valued card than any other player.[9]\n",
    "\n",
    ">Each player starts the game with the same number of chips or counters, usually two to four. When the game is played for money, all players contribute the same amount to a central pot. Each player is dealt one card face-down, after which play begins with the player to the left of the dealer. After examining this card, a player may either keep it or exchange it with the player on the left. However, if the intended recipient is holding a card of the highest value (depending on which set of rankings is being used), the recipient turns that card face-up and the trade is nullified. Any player who shows a top-value card in this manner is considered to have finished for that hand. Play proceeds clockwise around the table, with the dealer playing last; instead of trading cards with someone else, though, the dealer may exchange his or her card for the top one from the deck.\n"
